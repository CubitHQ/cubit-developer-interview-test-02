index.html contains a form widget that displays quotes from the Harry Potter books and movies. Everything is contained in index.html. The app isn't working as expected. Character names aren't showing up in the dropdown and no quotes are displaying in the box below the form. 

## Task
1. Debug the page.
2. Comment the JS so a developer new to this page could quickly get an overview of the JS. Please don't comment every line, just comment enough for a quick glance reading.
